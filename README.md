<h1> Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction</h1>
<p>Heart attack prediction in machine learning refers to the use of machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart attack or developing a cardiovascular disease. It involves analyzing various risk factors and medical data to create a predictive model that can assess an individual's risk level.</p>
<p>Machine learning models for heart attack prediction typically utilize features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, family history, lifestyle factors, and medical history. By training the model on a dataset containing labeled instances of heart attack occurrences, the model learns patterns and correlations between these features and the likelihood of a heart attack.</p>
<p>Once trained, the model can be used to predict the probability of a heart attack for a new individual based on their input features. This prediction can help healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who are at a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack, allowing for early intervention, preventive measures, and personalized treatment plans.</p>
